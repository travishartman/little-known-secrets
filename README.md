little-known-secrets
====================

A site designed to house a variety of "secrets" reporters gathered about columbia missouri.  In an effort to make the presentation novel, I tried to gamify the interaction a little, by
creating a randomly placed invisible (unitl rolled over) question marks that wold trigger the user to click, then reveal the secrets about the city in which they live.
Each time the page loads, each secret is in a different place, so no two visit are ever the same.  Need to certainly correct the interaction structure, 
as cards will dissappear after a certain amount of time, but can be supplanted by the next secret if the next question mark is clicked too soon.
also, the flipping card is a bit janky and could do with a more refined target.  Was planning on installing a counter to count down (from 68) how many secrets the user had found in order to give them a goal to reach and also to know how many were left once they were roaming about with their curson and not finding anything.
This option was not realized by deadline in effort to have a the backbone of the site working.  Slated for version 2.
